# 🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

Driver drowsiness is one of the major causes of road accidents. This project implements a computer vision–based solution to detect driver drowsiness in real-time using a webcam feed. The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset of open and closed eyes, and then deployed to continuously monitor eye states to raise alerts when drowsiness is detected.
